RFCs
====

RFCs are how substantial changes to Remits are decided upon.
Bug fixes and small features don't require RFCs, but large changes to the scope and abilities of Remits do.
An RFC must be merged before work begins on a large change.

### Process

We want to keep the process super lightweight:

- Copy the `00000-template.md` file with a new name like `00000-your-feature-here.md`. Don't give it a number yet.
- Fill out the RFC's contents and open a PR to merge it into master.
- Discuss the proposal in the comments of the PR. Make any changes necessary based on that discussion.
- When there's enough agreement for a maintainer to feel it should be merged, change the number to one higher than the last RFC merged.
- The RFC will then be merged and work can begin on it.
