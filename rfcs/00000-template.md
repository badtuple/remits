- Feature Name: (fill me in with a unique ident, `my_awesome_feature`)
- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- RFC PR: [remits/rfcs#0000](https://github.com/badtuple/remits/pull/0000)

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why do this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Design
[explanation]: #explanation

Explain the change and any details you feel are necessary. That generally means you should:

- Introduce new named concepts.
- Explain the feature largely in terms of examples, as a user would see them in documentation.
- Explain how users should *think* about the feature, and how it impacts the way they use Remits.
- Explain how it interacts with other features.
- Point out any edge cases a user might run into.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please be realistic. Literally every change is a
tradeoff.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

This section is optional, but _highly_ recommended.

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
Usually this is how other databases or streaming systems have approached the
problem. This can also reference other RFCs that did or didn't make it, as well
as papers or other materials.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

Point out open questions. This is a starting point for discussion in the PR.

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in future work?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This section is optional.

If this is implemented, are there natural extensions or next steps for the feature or Remits as a whole?
A clear view of what Remits looks like in the long term might help justify the RFC.
This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.
